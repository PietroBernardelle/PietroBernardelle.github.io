Hey there! I'm Pietro, a PhD candidate at The University of Queensland focused on the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and social science. Under the supervision of [Professor Gianluca Demartini](https://www.gianlucademartini.net/) and [Dr. Kevin Roitero](https://kevinroitero.com/), my research explores biases in current LLMs, develops mitigation strategies, and analyzes their impact on users.

My recent work includes a short paper on influencing political ideology in LLMs (The Web Conference 2025, formerly WWW), optimizing preference learning for LLMs (SIGIR-AP), and creating tools to evaluate LLM alignment.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering of Computing Systems from Polytechnic University of Milan (PoliMi), followed by a Master of Science in Computer Science & Engineering with AI specialization. I was awarded a scholarship for a double degree program between The University of Queensland (UQ) and PoliMi, completing a Master of Engineering Science (Management) with a Software Engineering major at UQ earning a Dean's Commendation for Academic Excellence.

Currently, I work as a tutor for Data Analysis at Scale (DATA7201) at UQ. 
<!-- Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant and Research Intern at UQ and [CIRES](https://cires.org.au/), contributing to projects on Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning for Pair Selection under Professor Demartini's guidance. -->
