Hey there! I’m Pietro Bernardelle, a PhD candidate at The University of Queensland (DLab). I’m under the eagle eyes of [Professor Gianluca Demartini](https://www.gianlucademartini.net/) and [Dr. Kevin Roitero](https://kevinroitero.com/).

My research focuses on information retrieval, including basic research into retrieval models, query processing, evaluation, and applications to health and medicine.
